# Joystick-Controlled DC Motor System using PIC16F887A

This embedded systems project uses a **PIC16F887A microcontroller**, a **2-axis joystick**, and two **DC motors** driven by an **L298 dual H-bridge motor driver**. The system reads analog joystick inputs and adjusts motor speed and direction accordingly using PWM signals.

## ðŸ”§ Components Used

- PIC16F887A Microcontroller
- L298 Motor Driver IC
- 2 DC Motors
- Joystick Module (X/Y axis)
- 12V and 9V Power Supplies
- Capacitors, resistors, LEDs
- Crystal oscillator (20MHz)
- Proteus 8.0 (for simulation)

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Joystick Input**: The joystick outputs analog voltage levels (0â€“5V) depending on its X/Y tilt.
2. **ADC**: The PIC microcontroller reads analog values using its ADC module.
3. **PWM Control**: Based on the ADC result, the motors are controlled via PWM for variable speed and direction.
4. **L298**: Dual H-Bridge motor driver receives PWM + direction signals to drive the motors.
